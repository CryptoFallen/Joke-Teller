# Joke-Teller

Joke Teller Project built with Vanilla JS by following the Zero To Mastery Course:(JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio). Utilising and working with Vanilla JavaScript to build a better understanding of JavaScript first without the need of utilising libraries and frameworks.

Jokes can be adjusted by changing apiUrl from:https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/

I will have to revisit this project once again to learn more and clean up the code.
